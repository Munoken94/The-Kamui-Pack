# Don't Lose Your Way!  

<p align="left">
A collection of characters I decided on making from the Kill La Kill series that I'll be working on as time passes on and will be providing updates when I can. I'll be adding more characters from the show along the way but at the moment, the Kamui pack comes included with all of everyone that is showcased below, Along with their stat blocks and rivals that they'll be pitted against during GP runs.

# Extra Details
<p align="left">
This pack comes in multiple variants. One featuring English voice lines and the other featuring their Japanese Voices. I should also note that there is also a SRB2Kart variant available as well to those who are still active playing it with the caveat of my version of Ryuko and Satsuki being excluded as Lat's version of them is still available on the <a href="https://mb.srb2.org/threads/v7-animechars-dot-pk3.26238/">SRB2 Message Boards</a>.
<br>
<br>
That being said, You can grab the version of your choosing provided at the top of this readme.

Have Fun!
