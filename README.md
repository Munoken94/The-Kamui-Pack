<p align="center">
A collection of characters I decided on making from the Kill La Kill series that I'll be working on as time passes on and will be providing updates when I can. I'll be adding more characters from the show along the way but at the moment, the Kamui pack comes included with all of everyone that is showcased below, Along with their stat blocks and rivals that they'll be pitted against during GP runs.
